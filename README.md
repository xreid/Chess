## What I've Learned From This Project

Although I am now working on some larger projects for school, when I started development on this project, it was the largest project I had ever taken on. Prior to this project (and in the beginning of this project), I would often just start writing code instead of designing classes and figuring out how they should all interact with each other. From this project I now know first hand that this practice results in spaghetti code and a lot of refactoring. That being said, this project needs some major refactoring.

All methods related to moving a chess piece need to be optimized in order to increase the effectiveness of the minimax algorithm, and sloppy code needs to be cleaned up and documented.
